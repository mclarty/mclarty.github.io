# What is this?

This is a document that is intended to help you understand me better and to also help us work together.  It is not intended as a replacement for personal interactions that will enable us to actually get to know each other.

# About me

I started down the path to today in 1999, when I began working as a dispatcher at a moderately-sized police department.  Like many small organizations, the person most qualified in a particular task tends to be the one owning that task--for me that was being the IT person.  Over the next ten years, I did everything from desktop support to network engineer, server administrator, and full-stack developer and integrator (my biggest achievement at the time was probably making a Clipper application with a dBase backend talk nicely to a PHP web application with mySQL backend).  

Along the way, I enlisted in the Air Force Reserve in 2003 as a security forces (military police) member.  As happens in the military, folks tend to get bounced around doing additional duties depending on mission requirements.  Once again, being the experienced IT person made me the information systems security officer for my unit, which led me to obtaining my Security+ certification and started my interest in cybersecurity.  I also spent a good amount of time in information and personnel security management for national security programs.

In 2009, I was presented with an opportunity to come work for Texas A&M as a systems analyst at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute where I worked with a variety of systems in both Windows and Linux environments, as well as the underlying network and VMware infrastructure.  In 2012, I was offered the information security officer position where I spent the next 7 years.  In that time, I overhauled the agency's information security program to align with NIST standards, streamlined many manual processes to capitalize on automation and consistency, and made use of every available opportunity to reduce the impact of security on the user by implementing measures in the background.

I am a husband and father to one five year old daughter, so in my (not so) spare time I am also a pilot and volunteer with Civil Air Patrol.

# My availability

I always work during normal business hours of 8am - 5pm.  Often I work from home for a few hours in the morning, and also regularly work at night and on weekends.  Very few things are more important than talking to you, so even if you don't see me in the office feel free to send me a message on Slack.  Also feel free to put a meeting on my calendar.

# Personal principles / My role

My job is to set up this team for success and autonomy by ensuring everyone has the necessary tools and resources to be successful.  I assume that you are very good at your job, I am not good at your job, and you will let me know if you can't do your job.
